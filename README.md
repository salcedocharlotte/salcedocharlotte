😄 Pronouns: I/told/you/so

⚡ Fun fact: I'm female, but everything I do is related to traditionally male interests. I game, code, and spend most of my time on my computer or drawing, engaging in activities typically associated with males. However, my interests doesnt mean I believe I'm a man or some crazy mess.  I just prefer the company of males and find it difficult to connect with other females, I believe males to be a superior species. I don't have tattoos, piercings, or unconventional hair colors. I don't wear jewelry, and I prefer a simple, minimalist style, often opting for a black hoodie, black pants, and an occasional band t-shirt when it gets hot. I embrace a subtle femininity that doesn't seek attention, focusing on being reserved and well-dressed. I identify as an introvert and, unfortunately, have Asperger's syndrome, which means I tend to talk extensively about subjects I'm passionate about, often misinterpreted as being social. In reality, I have high-functioning autism, which impairs my ability to pick up on social cues or realize when my conversations may be offensive. This poses challenges, which is why I gravitated toward a field where I can work with like-minded individuals.
Pet peeves: I have sensory sensitivities that make it uncomfortable to wear or touch certain materials, which is why I avoid jewelry. I dislike being coerced into doing things against my will, even in non-work settings. I have a strong aversion to working with individuals who are not truly team-oriented, as I often end up doing the entire project by myself while others are distracted. I'm also put off by insincere people and am easily disturbed by a disorganized or dirty environment. Additionally, I dislike driving.

𝐌𝐲 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐬: I have a deep appreciation for nature, animals, and kindness. I particularly adore cats. Coding is one of my passions, and my computer is my most cherished possession. I have a keen interest in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and thoroughly enjoy conducting research.

𝐈 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐊𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐚: I subscribe to the belief that negative actions come back sevenfold, which is why I strive to be kind and good. However, I have zero tolerance for abuse. I respect all religions and see commonalities among them, but my primary faith lies in Jesus, and I refrain from working on Sundays.

𝐌𝐲 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: I'm known for my straightforwardness, honesty, and old-fashioned values. I possess an old soul and advocate for equal treatment for all without exceptions. I also believe that those uncomfortable with the work environment should have the option to work from home rather than imposing changes on everyone else.

𝐌𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬: My grammar and spelling occasionally suffer due to laziness. I'm brutally honest and don't conform to groupthink. I can be stubborn and passionately dedicated to my work, sometimes to the point of working excessively long hours. While some may perceive this as a threat, it's simply my determination to finish tasks to the best of my ability. Failure to meet my own standards can make me physically ill, and I thrive when supervised by someone who is equally honest and demanding.

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐬: I don't give up easily, especially on jobs, unless the job or employer has given up on me. I have a keen sense for detecting dishonesty and insincerity. I possess various gifts and approach problems strategically, much like a chess game.

𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞: My favorite song is "Sorry You're Not a Winner" by Enter Shikari. [Link to the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4MiC67seUY)

𝐌𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐲𝐥𝐞: I have a dark, unbothered, realist style, often seen wearing hoodies.
