𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐬: I don't give up easily, especially on jobs. I have a keen sense for detecting dishonesty and insincerity. I possess various gifts and approach problems strategically, much like a chess game.

𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞: My favorite song is "Sorry You're Not a Winner" by Enter Shikari. [Link to the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4MiC67seUY)

𝐌𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐲𝐥𝐞: I have a dark, unbothered, realist style, often seen wearing hoodies.
